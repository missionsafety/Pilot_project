Introduction
Welcome to the "Create Requirement" GitHub repository! This repository is dedicated to a tool that facilitates the creation of requirements for safety-critical systems. The tool is designed to help you:

*Suggest work products based on the ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) type.
*Recommend appropriate hardware, software, and system tools for developing those work products, along with confidence level assessments.
*List further standards to execute different analyses.
*Generate VR (Verification and Validation) CR (Change Request) templates for the work products.
*Create test plans and safety project plans.
*Develop assessment and audit ideas.
*Generate architecture ideas for safety-critical systems.
